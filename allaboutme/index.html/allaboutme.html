    <h2>Rachel Christian</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Rachel Christian. I live in Tucson, Arizona. Originally, I'm from Rhode Island. Since marrying my husband 25+ years ago, we've moved around a bit. This is the longest we've ever
    been in one place - almost 9 years! My husband keeps saying we need to move! </p>
    <p>My family consists of four wonderful children. My oldest is a daughter who is married and studying for her masters in Utah. My second is a son who is away for school in Spain. My third is a son who is on a mission in Whales. So, all that's left at home with me are my last child, a senior in high school who runs away from his problems (he's in cross country), and my husband, who makes up numbers (he's in finance).</p>
    <p> I know nothing about computers but am interested in learning. I chose this field because I love logic and creativity and I thought this might be something worth pursuing. </p>
