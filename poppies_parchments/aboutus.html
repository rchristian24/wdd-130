<h1>Hi! I'm Poppy!</h1>

<section class = "about">
    <p>Hi! I’m Poppy. Ever since I was a little girl I have loved to design and get creative! (Which wasn’t always good for Mom’s walls!)</p>
    <p>As I got older, I was able to channel that creativity into going to the Art Institute of Chicago where I continued to learn how to expand my creative horizons even more (way past Mom’s walls!).</p>
    <p>While there I met an old gypsy woman at a fair. She looked straight into my eyes and told me that I was going to be bit by a wolf and become a werewolf. That’s when I realized life is short and I should do what I love.</p>
    <p>And I love making cards and making people happy! So, I left Chicago and came home to Smalltown and opened Poppies Parchments. It was rough sailing at first.</p>
    <p>Mailing cards is becoming a thing of the past. But just as a hurricane starts with one raindrop, so too, did it all start with one card. The mayor’s card. </p>
    <p>When Sylvia Smith was elected mayor, I sent her a congratulatory card (one of many in Poppies Parchments). When Madame Mayor received my card, she was so taken with how it looked, she came and found my store and bought a card to send to a friend.</p>
    <p>That friend was so taken with Madame Mayor’s card that she found Poppies Parchments and bought a card to send to another friend. And on and on it went. </p>
    <p> I am still here because of YOU! Thank you Smalltown!</p>
    <p>P.S. I was only kidding about turning into a werewolf.</p>
    <p> Feel free to contact me by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or send me a message through the form below. I would love to hear from you!</p>
