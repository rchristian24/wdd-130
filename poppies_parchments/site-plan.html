        ABOUT COMPANY
        What is Poppies Parchments?
        Poppies Parchments is a handmade greeting card boutique. I believe happiness is always homemade and heartfelt. I started this company because I wanted to share the joy of creating beautiful cards with you (and a few other surprises. You never know what you will find!). Getting a card from someone always makes you feel good - a beautiful handmade one even more so! I didn't want to stop the good feeling with just selling cards, though. That's when I decided to have classes to teach different techniques so you, too, can come up with your own unique designs. Spread the love! Plus, being creative in a group is always more fun! So, come on by - I can’t wait to meet you!
        LOCATION
        We are located at 2038 Kay Street, Smalltown, Anywhere, 10001. We are across from Denny's and next to Pam's Pizza. (If you get to the Mobile Station, you have gone to far. Come back!)
        INVENTORY
        We have all kinds of cards! Some examples are:
        Birthday,
        Christmas,
        Get Well,
        Mothers Day,
        Fathers Day,
        Sassy,
        Exotic,
        Bold,
        And More…..
        All one of a kind, originals! (Custom card making is available but a surcharge of $5 is added.)

      </ul>
      <h3>CLASSES</h3>
      <p>
      Classes that we offer are: How to glaze. (Make that card shine!) How to emboss. (We all love 3-D!) How to make a Domino necklace. (Yes, I said domino.) How to make 3-D cutouts. (Did I mention we all love 3-D?) How to make your own rubber stamps. (Warning! This class is for the diehard stampers (but all are welcome!)) How to make a lavender aroma filled satchel. (Great for those sock drawers or under pillows!) Basic Card Making. (For those novices out there, ready to dip their toe in.) Holiday Wreath. (Small wreath, easy to make and I promise – you’ve never seen one like this before!)
      Classes are held on Tuesday evenings at 7:00pm and Saturdays at 9:00am. First class is always free. Subsequent classes are $8.00 a class (Sorry, I have to eat. It will be well worth it; I promise!)

      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>
        
Hi! I’m Poppy. Ever since I was a little girl I have loved to design and get creative! (Which wasn’t always good for Mom’s walls!) As I got older, I was able to channel that creativity into going to the Art Institute of Chicago where I continued to learn how to expand my creative horizons even more (way past Mom’s walls!). While there I met an old gypsy woman at a fair. She looked straight into my eyes and told me that I was going to be bit by a wolf and become a werewolf. That’s when I realized life is short and I should do what I love. And I love making cards and making people happy! So, I left Chicago and came home to Smalltown and opened Poppies Parchments. It was rough sailing at first. Mailing cards is becoming a thing of the past. But just as a hurricane starts with one raindrop, so too, did it all start with one card. The mayor’s card. When Sylvia Smith was elected mayor, I sent her a congratulatory card (one of many in Poppies Parchments). When Madame Mayor received my card, she was so taken with how it looked, she came and found my store and bought a card to send to a friend. That friend was so taken with Madame Mayor’s card that she found Poppies Parchments and bought a card to send to another friend. And on and on it went. I am still here because of YOU! Thank you Smalltown! P.S. I was only kidding about turning into a werewolf.

Feel free to contact me by Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. I would love to hear from you!
