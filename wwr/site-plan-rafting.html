    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>At Rachel's Rafting, we believe everyone has the right, the capability, and the magnitude to learn how to love nature and rafting.
        This website will feature articles for rafting enthusaists and to create rafting enthusaists. It will also have pictures to show the 
        different rafting tours others have enjoyed. It will list the dates of upcoming events. These things will lead our audience to click on the links to sign up for our variety of 
        rafting trips, from novice to experienced. The website will also have a FAQ link to answer any questions, as well as ways to contact our
        company if their question isn't answered in the FAQ.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience who would look at Rachel's Rafting are those who are interested in learning more about rafting and for those wanting to
        sign up with an experienced group to raft. Avid rafters will peruse this site to look for upcoming events and to enjoy rafting with other 
        enthusaists. The age group of our audience will range from millenials to baby boomers. They will most likely look at this website on their phone.
        Our audience will most likely be adventure seekers and nature lovers. The baby boomers (or those who are retired) will be the customers
        who most frequent us during the week. Millenials (or those who are still working) will come more on the weekends.
